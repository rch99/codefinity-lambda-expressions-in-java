Challenge: Stream Data Processing
Imagine you are managing payroll for a company and need to process a list of employee salaries. Your goal is to identify all employees earning above a certain threshold, give those employees a 10% raise, and then calculate the total cost of these increased salaries. Using Java's Stream API and lambda expressions can make this task concise and expressive, allowing you to filter, transform, and aggregate data efficiently in a single pipeline.
